S﻿ometimes I feel like I've stumbled across a secret that is true but that no one believes.  Running barefoot on grass is a great way to train and has continued to work for me over the years.

T﻿here is a massive running/shoe industry out there, and most everyone buys into it.  Expensive shoes, training plans, races, injury rehab, etc.  It's like a maze with no exit.

I﻿nstead, I go out to a field and run barefoot on grass 2 - 3x per week.  I run at an easy pace for the most part, but add in some sprints and other paces.  That's it.

T﻿his "system" has worked for me for many years.  I wake up and feel fine.  No injuries or issues.  I'm 54, and running continues to be enjoyable.

M﻿aybe if you're stuck or the typical running programs aren't working for you - give barefoot running on grass a try.  Drop me a line if you want to explore it (see About page).
