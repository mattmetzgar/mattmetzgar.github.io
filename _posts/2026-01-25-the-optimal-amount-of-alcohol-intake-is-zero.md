I﻿ remember reading years ago about things like "heart-healthy" red wine and such.  I never believed any of it.

T﻿he research now is pretty clear that no amount of alcohol is actually good for you.  Small amounts of alcohol probably don't cause much damage in terms of health.  But alcohol is not a health-promoting substance.

T﻿his doesn't mean that drinking alcohol is bad - it just means there are costs and benefits.  Lots of actions have risk yet we undertake them anyways.  Driving on the interstate is a risk but it gets people where they want to go.

A﻿nd so like anything else, having accurate information as opposed to wishful thinking can help people make better decisions.
