A﻿ growing trend I see in grocery stores is that the parent puts a tablet or phone for the child in the shopping cart.  This is in no way healthy for the child.

T﻿here is tons of research on this, showing screen time is not beneficial for young children.  

P﻿arenting young children is a ton of work, let's be honest.  But screens don't help young children in any way and are not necessary.
