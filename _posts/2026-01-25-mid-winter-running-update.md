M﻿y original plan was to run through the whole winter running barefoot on grass on warmer days.  I have made it so far to mid-January, but I have noticed some things.

W﻿hen running barefoot in the cold, it's hard to feel your feet and so the running stride can easily get sloppy.  It also takes a lot longer to really warm up and get going.

I﻿ did some research on hunter-gatherers and whether they ever took "breaks" from endurance running throughout the year.  The answer is yes.  Due to weather patterns, hunter-gatherers would usually have an "off-season" of 30 to 90 days with no endurance running.

S﻿o the answer to my question of how to run barefoot in cold weather appears to have a simple answer - don't run.  I plan to run sparingly in February and then get back to regular running in March.
