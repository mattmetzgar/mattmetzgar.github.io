I﻿ see much more writing about the dangers of screen time and phones, but very little change in actual behavior.  At some point, awareness of a problem is not enough - action is needed.  

G﻿oing outside into green space is a first step.  Just a few minutes can reset your perspective.

S﻿ee you out there.
