title: Running is Hip Extension

W﻿henever my running form feels off, I try to focus on running in its simplest form.  In my view, running is essentially hip extension.  

The only way to move forward in running is by applying force to the ground.  Therefore, the body needs to apply a force vector directed down and back.  This comes from hip extension.

H﻿ip extension is simply the thigh bone moving backwards.  After your leg cycles forward, you direct the thigh bone down and back.  That's the main running motion.

E﻿verything else - posture, foot landing, etc. - are all things that either follow hip extension or allow hip extension to take place.

F﻿or example, if you are bent over at the waist, it's going to be hard to allow your thigh to come forward and then travel down and generate force.  Improving your posture in this case is a means to an end: it allows your thigh to travel forward properly, which then allows you to rotate it back and generate force.
