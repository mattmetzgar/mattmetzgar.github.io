S﻿ocial media is distorting people's view of the aging process.  It takes a small sliver of older adults who are fit and broadcasts their success.  It makes it seem like the norm when it is not.

D﻿iet and exercise is not all there is to aging.  Other components are genetics and plain luck.  Somehow those latter two rarely get mentioned.

H﻿ere's an interesting thought experiment: these fit, older people - notice there is no social media attention when they die.  About 150,000 people die every day, and some portion of those people must be fit.  Yet I never read anything about fit people dying.  It makes it seem like it isn't happening (that these fit people are somehow avoiding death), yet obviously in reality it is.

A﻿nother way to say it: the algorithm only cares about you if you are fit and performing for the camera.  If you die, oh well, the algorithm will just find another older fit person to take your place.  You simply get erased.

I﻿ think this is a terrible way to view aging.  Aging involves decay and loss of capability.   People deserve compassion during this process.  Real aging doesn't make for good tv, but it is an inevitable part of life.
