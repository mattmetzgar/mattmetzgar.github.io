A﻿ good amount of running advice says to run at 180 steps per minute, as that is what elite runners typically run at.

I﻿ have experimented with this pace over the years, but only occassionally.

H﻿owever, I have noticed it's a bit more useful with age.  Your reaction time slows with age.  So sometimes on a run, I will time myself to run at 180 steps per minute.  It seems to make my running more fluid, and so I'll do it for a few minutes or so to get a better feel for things.

T﻿herefore, I'd say it's a good tool to use, but it's probably not something that you need to rigorously adhere to.
