I﻿ read lots of proclamations online that if you don't lift weights as you age, you will become frail, get dementia, etc.  All of that is bullshit.

I﻿t's more correct to say that some type of muscular exertion is necessary as you age, but it does not have to be weight training.  There are many examples of people staying in shape through different paths.

W﻿hat happens is that someone who has a propensity for lifting weights does that as they age and gets good results.  And then they assume that because it worked for them, it will work for others.  That is not the case.

W﻿e all have different abilities and preferences.  For example, it's been quite hot the last week when I've been running.  But if you give me a choice - would I rather go run outside in 95 degrees or lift weights in an air-conditioned gym - it's not even close.  I'll be out running.

B﻿ut I'm aware others have different preferences.  And that's how it goes as you age - you have to follow your own physical inclinations and do what you enjoy.
