For most of human history, creativity was not self-motivated. Art and music emerged as responses to shared environments. People lived close together and moments of quiet or emotion naturally invited song, drawing, rhythm, or story. Creativity happened because the situation called for it.


Modern life removed those signals. We work indoors under artificial light, often alone, with no shared stopping points and no communal sense that “now is the time.” After removing the conditions that once made creativity automatic, we tell people that if they can’t draw, play music, or make things consistently, they lack motivation or discipline. 


If making art or music feels hard when you’re alone at home, that doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. It means the conditions have changed. Motivation used to be environmental, not psychological. It arose from presence, rhythm, constraint, and shared attention. When those cues disappeared, effort had to replace response — and creating became more difficult.


The issue, then, is not individual capacity but environmental fit. Ancient human behaviors are being asked to function in settings that no longer support them. Seeing this clearly reframes the problem and shifts the focus towards understanding the kinds of environments in which creativity naturally emerges.
