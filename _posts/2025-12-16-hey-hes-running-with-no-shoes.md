title: Hey, He's Running with No Shoes

U﻿sually in the winter, I run with minimal shoes, but this winter I'm trying a different approach.  I try to find days and times when the weather is warm enough to continue running barefoot on grass.

I﻿'ve found that running in the low 40s is doable, but the 30s - not so much.  So I try to run on certain days and usually in the late afternoon when the temperature is the highest.

I﻿ was running yesterday at the field and some kids at the playground saw me.  "Hey, he's running with no shoes on!"  Yes, indeed.  And it feels pretty good.
