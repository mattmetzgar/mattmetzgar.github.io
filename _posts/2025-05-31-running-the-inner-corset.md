I﻿ think one of the more subtle aspects of running is upper body posture.  In her wonderful book, [8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back](https://www.amazon.com/0979303605-Esther-Gokhale/dp/0979303605), Esther Gokhale discusses the concept of the inner corset.

T﻿he inner corset consists of the abdominal muscles that keep the back from arching too much.  In running, there can be a tendency for the back to arch and the bottom of the rib cage to flare out.

When running, if the back arches too much then the weight of the head gets behind the hips.  This slows things down and makes running less efficient.

W﻿ith the inner corset engaged, the upper body is more vertical in posture and that makes for more efficient running.
